shutdown_costmaps: false # Determines whether or not to shutdown the costmaps of the node when move_base is in an inactive state

controller_frequency: 5.0 # The rate in Hz at which to run the control loop and send velocity commands to the base.
controller_patience: 15.0 # How long the controller will wait in seconds without receiving a valid control before space-clearing operations are performed.

planner_frequency: 0.0 # The rate in Hz at which to run the global planning loop. If the frequency is set to 0.0, the global planner will only run when a new goal is received or the local planner reports that its path is blocked.
planner_patience: 10.0 # How long the planner will wait in seconds in an attempt to find a valid plan before space-clearing operations are performed.

oscillation_timeout: 10.0 # How long in seconds to allow for oscillation before executing recovery behaviors. 
oscillation_distance: 0.2 # How far in meters the robot must move to be considered not to be oscillating. Moving this far resets the timer counting up to the ~oscillation_timeout
