# roboraider
This is a ROS package for my home-built robot. The development was done under Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and ROS Indigo.

Dependencies:
* depthimage_to_laserscan
* openni2_camera
* for a working teleop panel in rviz: modified visualization_tutorials by me

Arduino libraries needed to compile the Arduino code for the low level controller:
* BMSerial
* LiquidCrystal_I2C
* RoboClaw
* UM7 (extended by me)
